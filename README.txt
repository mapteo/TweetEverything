TweetEverything allows tweeting highlighted text.

== Description ==

If readers of your wordpress site/blog come across a snippet of text they want to Tweet, you know the drill: they have to copy it, open Twitter, create a new message, then paste in the text there and then hit the send button...itâ€™s not that difficult, but what if there was an even easier way?
Well, there is, and here it is. TweetEverything allows tweeting highlighted text with a single click. See screenshots.

== Installation ==

1. Copy the zip file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
